        <h2>Krishnamurti on Mental Health</h2>
    </div>
    <p>HAVING BEEN TABOO for decades, if not centuries, mental health is now being widely discussed. During these exceptional times of pandemic, many of us are confronted with psychological problems related to isolation, anxiety, loneliness, frustrations, addictions, insecurities, depression, fears and worry – issues regularly addressed by Krishnamurti. Throughout his talks and discussions, Krishnamurti reveals that we are conditioned to have problems and that taking them personally may be a fundamental error. Moreover, the realisation that one’s loneliness, for example, is common to all humanity, is essential to understanding it, being free of it and learning what it is to be fundamentally secure and well in an uncertain world.</p>
    <p>How is mental health to be measured, and what does it mean to be truly healthy?</p>
    <p>‘It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society’ is perhaps Krishnamurti’s best-known quote, shared widely across the internet. Although we cannot attribute these exact words to Krishnamurti, he made similar statements over the decades, and it is a theme he returned to repeatedly. So, if not in relation to society, how is health, specifically mental health, to be measured, and what does it mean to be truly healthy? As we shall see in this article, a specially selected collection of text and video extracts, Krishnamurti’s notion of mental health goes way beyond that of society’s, challenging the limited approach of analysts, psychologists and religions, revealing an unshakable order, harmony and sanity.</p>
    <p>THE PURSUIT OF THE PSYCHOANALYST has become a hobby of the well-to-do. You may not go to a psychoanalyst but you go through the same process in a different way when you look to a religious organisation, to a leader or to a discipline to free you from fixations, inhibitions and complexes. These methods may succeed in creating superficial effects, but they inevitably develop new resistances against the movement of life. No person or technique can free one from these limitations. To experience that freedom, one must comprehend life deeply and discern for oneself the process of creating and maintaining ignorance and illusion. This demands alertness and keen perception, not the mere acceptance of a technique. But as one is slothful, one depends on another for comprehension and thereby increase sorrow and confusion. The comprehension of this process of ignorance and its self-sustaining activities can alone bring about deep, abiding bliss.</p>
    <p>Question: How Do People Become Neurotic?
        KRISHNAMURTI: How do we know they are neurotic? Please, this is a very serious question. Neurotic – what does that mean? A little odd, unclear, confused, slightly off-balance? Unfortunately, most of us are slightly off-balance. No? You aren’t quite sure! Aren’t you off-balance if you are a Christian, a Hindu, a Buddhist or a communist? Aren’t you neurotic when you enclose yourself with your problems, build a wall around yourself because you think you are better than somebody else? Aren’t you off-balance when your life is full of resistance – me and you, we and they, and all the other divisions? Aren’t you neurotic in the office when you want to be better than another?
        
        So, how does one become neurotic? Does society make you neurotic? That is the simplest explanation – my father or mother, my neighbour, the government, the army, everybody makes me neurotic. Are they all responsible for my being off-balance? And when I go to the analyst for help, poor chap, he’s also neurotic like me. Please, don’t laugh; this is exactly what is happening in the world. So why do I become neurotic? Everything in the world, as it exists now, the society, the family, the parents, the children, have no love. Do you think there would be wars if we had love? Do you think there would be governments that consider it is perfectly all right for you to be killed? Such a society would not exist if your mother and father really loved you, cared for you, looked after you and taught you how to be kind, how to live and how to love. These are the outer pressures and demands that bring about this neurotic society. There are also the inner compulsions and urges within ourselves, our innate violence inherited from the past, that help to make up this neurosis, this imbalance.</p>
