        <p>  An anxiety disorder is a type of mental health condition. If you have an anxiety disorder, you may respond to certain things and situations with fear and dread. You may also experience physical signs of anxiety, such as a pounding heart and sweating.
            It’s normal to have some anxiety. You may feel anxious or nervous if you have to tackle a problem at work, go to an interview, take a test or make an important decision. And anxiety can even be beneficial. For example, anxiety helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our attention, so we stay safe.
            But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time to time. An anxiety disorder happens when:<br>
            <ul>
            <li> interferes with your ability to function.</li>
            <li>You often overreact when something triggers your emotions.</li>
            <li>You can’t control your responses to situations.</li>
        </ul>
            Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to get through the day. Fortunately, there are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders.
